# Foodprint

Foodprint is a platform where farmers/suppliers and restaurants find each other, and form more sustainable, direct local partnerships. 
As a result they cut that middleman – the big distribution- as well as that huge carbon footprint.
Restaurant users are also part of the equation, since by joining Foodprint, they can easily find sustainable restaurants in their area, and choose where to eat based on the restaurant's eco-scores.
